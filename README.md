This is a personal repository and you should use it carrefully. It's all about my personal working/gaming/anything environment. It's a mess.

Here is my initial configuration:
- Windows 10 updated
- Terminal from Windows Store
- Ubuntu (didn't try an other distro)

### Todos
You can see todos on Issues tab. Maybe you can help me and contribute to it :-)
