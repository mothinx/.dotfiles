# My Dotfiles

This is a personal repository and you should use it carrefully. It's all about my personal working/gaming/anything environment. 

It's a mess.

Here is my initial configuration:
- Windows 10 updated
- Terminal from Windows Store
- Ubuntu (didn't try an other distro)

#### Configuration:
You need to set environment variables **TRELLO_API_KEY / TRELLO_TOKEN / GTD_INBOX_ID**
