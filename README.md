# My Dotfiles

This is a personal repository and you should use it carrefully. It's all about my personal working/gaming/anything environment. 

It's a mess.

Here is my initial configuration:
- Windows 10 updated
- Terminal from Windows Store
- Ubuntu (didn't try an other distro)

## Scripts

### Trello.py

Used to create a card in a Trello Board using a commandLine.
#### Configuration:
You need to set environment variables **TRELLO_API_KEY / TRELLO_TOKEN / GTD_INBOX_ID**
#### How to Use:
  ```python3 trello.py Your_Card_Name```
## Todos
[ ] I need a wrapper to run on WSL my python script trello.py
You can see todos on Issues tab. Maybe you can help me and contribute to it :-)
